# PR #461 Rounding Consistency Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified by Gemini Code Assist

**HIGH Priority Issue**: Rounding inconsistency in `schemas/metrics.py` line ~326
- Was using `ROUND_HALF_UP` for quantization
- `metrics_extractor.py` and project documentation specify `ROUND_HALF_EVEN` for deterministic rounding
- Inconsistent rounding methods could lead to non-deterministic behavior

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation using context7 MCP and codebase analysis:
1. **Engineering/CAD files** were mixed - some using ROUND_HALF_UP, others ROUND_HALF_EVEN
2. **Financial files** correctly use ROUND_HALF_UP for regulatory compliance
3. **One file** (`financial.py`) was using string `'ROUND_HALF_UP'` instead of the constant

## Changes Made

### Engineering/CAD/Metrics Files (Changed to ROUND_HALF_EVEN)
1. **`apps/api/app/schemas/metrics.py`**
   - Changed import from `ROUND_HALF_UP` to `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`
   - Updated quantize call to use `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`

2. **`apps/api/app/services/freecad_rules_engine.py`**
   - Changed import from `ROUND_HALF_UP` to `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`
   - Updated `_round_decimal` method to use `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`

3. **`apps/api/app/services/ai_adapter.py`**
   - Changed import from `ROUND_HALF_UP` to `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`
   - Updated cost calculation quantize to use `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`

### Financial Files (Fixed string usage, kept ROUND_HALF_UP)
1. **`apps/api/app/schemas/financial.py`**
   - Added `ROUND_HALF_UP` to import statement
   - Changed string `'ROUND_HALF_UP'` to constant `ROUND_HALF_UP` (2 occurrences)

## Rationale for Rounding Methods

### ROUND_HALF_EVEN (Banker's Rounding)
**Used for:** Engineering, CAD, metrics, AI calculations
- **Benefits:**
  - IEEE 754 standard compliant
  - Reduces cumulative bias in large datasets
  - Provides deterministic, reproducible results
  - Minimizes rounding errors in statistical calculations

### ROUND_HALF_UP (Traditional Rounding)
**Used for:** Financial calculations, VAT/KDV, currency conversion
- **Benefits:**
  - Required for Turkish VAT compliance
  - German and Swiss tax laws require this for VAT
  - Matches traditional financial expectations
  - Ensures regulatory compliance

## Files Now Consistent

| File | Rounding Method | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| `metrics_extractor.py` | ROUND_HALF_EVEN | Model metrics extraction |
| `schemas/metrics.py` | ROUND_HALF_EVEN | Metrics display formatting |
| `freecad_rules_engine.py` | ROUND_HALF_EVEN | FreeCAD normalization |
| `ai_adapter.py` | ROUND_HALF_EVEN | AI cost calculations |
| `invoice_service.py` | ROUND_HALF_UP | Turkish KDV calculations |
| `schemas/financial.py` | ROUND_HALF_UP | Financial validation |
| `models/validators.py` | ROUND_HALF_UP | Currency conversion |

## Verification

Created comprehensive test script (`test_rounding_consistency.py`) that verifies:
- ✅ ROUND_HALF_EVEN behavior for engineering calculations
- ✅ ROUND_HALF_UP behavior for financial calculations
- ✅ Real-world examples showing the difference
- ✅ All files using consistent rounding methods

## Impact

1. **Deterministic Behavior**: Engineering calculations now use consistent ROUND_HALF_EVEN
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial calculations maintain ROUND_HALF_UP for VAT
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Each domain uses appropriate rounding for its requirements
4. **Documentation**: Created `ROUNDING_STANDARDS.md` for future reference

## Best Practices Applied

1. Always use `Decimal` for precision-critical calculations
2. Use string literals for Decimal initialization: `Decimal('0.1')` not `Decimal(0.1)`
3. Always specify rounding parameter explicitly
4. Document domain-specific rounding requirements
5. Test edge cases, particularly .5 values
