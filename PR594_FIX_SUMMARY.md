# PR #594 Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. GD&T Validation Logic Error (CRITICAL) ✅
**File**: `apps/api/app/services/standards_checker.py` (line 312)

**Issue**: The validation was checking for exact equality between measured deviation and tolerance
```python
# WRONG:
return feature.get("value") == feature.get("expected")
```

**Fix**: Corrected to check if deviation is within tolerance
```python
# CORRECT:
return feature.get("value") <= feature.get("expected")
```

**Explanation**: In GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing), the measured deviation must be less than or equal to the allowed tolerance for the part to pass inspection. This follows the standard GD&T validation principle where:
- PASS: Measured deviation ≤ Allowed tolerance
- FAIL: Measured deviation > Allowed tolerance

## High Priority Issues Fixed

### 2. Test Assertions Don't Match Schema (HIGH) ✅
**File**: `apps/api/tests/test_model_validation.py` (lines 691-692, 718-719)

**Issue**: Tests were accessing FixReport fields as lists when they are integers
```python
# WRONG:
assert len(report.successful) == 1
assert len(report.failed) == 0
assert len(report.skipped) == 1
```

**Fix**: Updated to use correct integer fields
```python
# CORRECT:
assert report.successful_fixes == 1
assert report.failed_fixes == 0
assert report.skipped_fixes == 1
```

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 3. Quantity Discount Magic Numbers ✅
**File**: `apps/api/app/api/v2/model_validation.py` (lines 72-77, 252-257)

**Added Constants**:
```python
# Quantity discount thresholds and rates
QUANTITY_LARGE = 100
QUANTITY_MEDIUM = 50
QUANTITY_SMALL = 10
DISCOUNT_LARGE = 0.85
DISCOUNT_MEDIUM = 0.9
DISCOUNT_SMALL = 0.95
```

**Updated Usage**:
```python
if request.quantity > QUANTITY_LARGE:
    quantity_discount = DISCOUNT_LARGE  # 15% discount for 100+
elif request.quantity > QUANTITY_MEDIUM:
    quantity_discount = DISCOUNT_MEDIUM   # 10% discount for 50+
elif request.quantity > QUANTITY_SMALL:
    quantity_discount = DISCOUNT_SMALL  # 5% discount for 10+
```

### 4. Default Material Properties ✅
**File**: `apps/api/app/services/manufacturing_validator.py` (lines 53-54, 1327)

**Added Constants**:
```python
# Default material properties for generic materials
DEFAULT_GENERIC_DENSITY = 2.0  # g/cm³
DEFAULT_GENERIC_COST_PER_KG = 2.0  # $/kg
```

**Updated Usage**:
```python
# Generic material
return (Decimal(str(DEFAULT_GENERIC_DENSITY)), Decimal(str(DEFAULT_GENERIC_COST_PER_KG)))
```

## Summary
All four issues from PR #594 feedback have been successfully addressed:
- ✅ Critical GD&T validation logic fixed
- ✅ Test assertions corrected to match schema
- ✅ Magic numbers replaced with named constants
- ✅ All Turkish messages preserved

The fixes ensure proper tolerance validation following GD&T standards and improve code maintainability by replacing magic numbers with descriptive constants.
