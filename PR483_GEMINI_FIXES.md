# PR #483 - Gemini Review Feedback Fixes

## Summary
Fixed all high and medium priority issues identified in the Gemini review for PR #483.

## Changes Made

### 1. **HIGH - Async Type Hint Fixed** (apps/api/app/core/cache.py)
- **Issue**: `compute_func` parameter was typed as just `Callable` but is called with `await`
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `Awaitable` to imports from typing
  - Changed type hint to `Callable[[], Awaitable[Any]]`
  - This ensures proper type checking for async functions

### 2. **HIGH - Lock Wait Logic Improved** (apps/api/app/core/cache.py lines 927-963)
- **Issue**: Previous logic waited only 1 second then computed anyway, causing thundering herd
- **Fix**: 
  - Implemented proper polling loop with exponential backoff
  - Start with 200ms poll interval, increase to max 1 second
  - Added random jitter (-0.05 to 0.05) to prevent synchronization
  - Raise `CacheException` with `LOCK_TIMEOUT` error instead of computing
  - Total timeout respects `config.lock_timeout_seconds`
  - Prevents multiple workers from computing the same expensive value

### 3. **MEDIUM - Imports Moved to Top** (multiple files)
- **Issue**: Inline imports found in functions
- **Fix in cache.py**:
  - Moved `import base64` from line 355 to top (line 26)
  - Moved `import subprocess` from line 787 to top (line 33)
  - Added `import random` to top (line 31) for jitter calculation
- **Fix in freecad_worker_optimizer.py**:
  - Added `import asyncio` to top (line 23)
  - Removed inline `import asyncio` from lines 359 and 423

### 4. **MEDIUM - Named Constant Defined** (apps/api/app/workers/freecad_worker_optimizer.py)
- **Issue**: Magic number `700 * 1024` not named
- **Fix**:
  - Defined `MAX_MEMORY_PER_CHILD_KB = 700 * 1024  # 700 MB in KB` at line 55
  - Updated usage at line 511 to use the constant

### 5. **MEDIUM - Template Usage Clarified** (apps/api/app/workers/freecad_worker_optimizer.py lines 582-591)
- **Issue**: Template created but content not copied
- **Fix**:
  - Added clarifying comment explaining the template's purpose
  - Template serves as warm-up for module loading and OCCT initialization
  - Each task creates its own geometry, so copying template objects is not needed
  - The template just ensures all modules are loaded and initialized

## Technical Details

### Lock Wait Algorithm
The new polling algorithm prevents thundering herd by:
1. Starting with a 200ms poll interval
2. Exponentially increasing the interval (factor of 1.5)
3. Adding random jitter to prevent synchronized polling
4. Capping the interval at 1 second
5. Raising an exception on timeout instead of computing

### Type Safety Improvements
- Proper async type hints ensure static analysis tools can verify async/await usage
- `Callable[[], Awaitable[Any]]` clearly indicates the function returns a coroutine

### Code Organization
- All imports now at module top following PEP 8
- Named constants improve maintainability and self-documentation
- Clear separation of configuration from implementation

## Testing
- Both modules compile successfully without syntax errors
- Type hints are compatible with Python 3.8+ typing system
- Lock wait logic tested with various timeout scenarios

## Impact
- **Performance**: Better cache stampede control reduces redundant computations
- **Reliability**: Proper timeout handling prevents resource exhaustion
- **Maintainability**: Named constants and proper imports improve code clarity
- **Type Safety**: Correct async type hints enable better IDE support and static analysis
