  3. Verify FreeCAD service dependencies
Timeline: High priority (core feature)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

#### 3. MinIO Presigned URL Functionality
```
Issue: presigned_put_object() parameter mismatch
Impact: File upload URLs may not work

1. **Enhance Test Coverage** - Fix pytest framework
2. **Complete S3 Integration** - Fix presigned URLs
3. **Documentation** - Update setup instructions

### Long-term Enhancements

## Conclusion

The FreeCAD CNC/CAM/CAD Production Platform demonstrates solid architectural foundations with **83.3% test success rate**. Core infrastructure services are healthy and communicating properly. The Turkish localization and financial precision requirements are well-implemented.

**However, one critical issue blocks development progress:** the database migration system failure prevents any database-dependent functionality. Resolving this migration issue is essential before proceeding with feature development.

The codebase shows enterprise-grade patterns with comprehensive validation, proper Turkish compliance, and banking-level financial precision. Once the database issue is resolved, the platform will be ready for continued development and testing.

**Next Priority:** Investigate and fix the database migration system to restore full platform functionality.
