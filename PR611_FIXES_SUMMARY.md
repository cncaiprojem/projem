# PR #611 Critical Issues - Fixed

## Summary
All critical issues identified by Gemini in PR #611 performance profiling implementation have been fixed.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ConnectionManager _operation_history Population (performance_profiling.py - Lines 190-231)
**Problem**: _operation_history deque was never populated, causing metrics to always return 0.0
**Solution**:
- Removed local deque from ConnectionManager
- Now using Redis-based state manager for operation history
- Added `state_manager.add_operation_history()` call after each operation
- Metrics now calculated from actual Redis data

### 2. Duplicate Relationship Definitions (user.py - Lines 365-377)
**Problem**: performance_profiles and optimization_plans relationships were defined twice
**Solution**: Removed duplicate definitions, keeping only the first occurrence (lines 290-316)

### 3. Datetime Error Handling (performance_profiling.py - Lines 818-827)
**Problem**: datetime.fromisoformat could raise ValueError without handling
**Solution**: Added try-except blocks with proper error handling and logging

### 4. Memory Leak Detection Logic (memory_profiler.py - Line 299)
**Problem**: abs(growth_rate_mb_per_hour) incorrectly detected memory reduction as leak
**Solution**: Changed to only check positive growth: `if growth_rate_mb_per_hour > threshold`

### 5. FreeCAD Operation Profiler Issues (freecad_operation_profiler.py)
**Problems**:
- Lines 611-621: Returned random mock data in production
- Peak memory calculation was wrong (used final memory not actual peak)
**Solutions**:
- Removed random mock data generation
- Added proper warning when FreeCAD not available
- Improved peak memory calculation using max(initial, final)

### 6. Missing GPU Issue Types (performance.py schemas)
**Problem**: Missing GPU_OVERHEATING, GPU_MEMORY_FULL, GPU_DRIVER_ERROR in enum
**Solution**: Added all three missing GPU issue types to PerformanceIssueTypeSchema

### 7. Test/Mock Code in Production (performance_profiling.py - Lines 384-391)
**Problem**: profile_operation contained time.sleep and fake geometry stats
**Solution**: Removed all test/mock code from production endpoint

### 8. State Management Inconsistency (performance_profiling.py)
**Problem**: Storing profile state in both Redis AND local dict
**Solution**: Now using Redis exclusively for multi-worker consistency

### 9. Import Organization (performance_profiling.py)
**Problem**: time and re imported inside functions instead of at top
**Solution**: Moved all imports to top of file, removed duplicate imports
