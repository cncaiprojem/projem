# PR #538 Gemini Code Review Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Job ID Inconsistency (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Problem**: Job IDs were generated as 64-bit integers in some places, inconsistent with 32-bit integers used elsewhere in the codebase.

**Files Fixed**:
- `apps/api/app/services/batch_import_export.py` (2 locations)
  - Line 587-588: Fixed `_import_single` method
  - Line 679-680: Fixed `_convert_single` method

**Solution**:
Changed from:
```python
job_id = int(job_id_hash[:16], 16)  # 64-bit integer
```
To:
```python
job_id = int(job_id_hash, 16) % (2**31)  # 32-bit signed integer
```

This ensures consistent job ID generation across the entire codebase using 32-bit signed integers.

### 2. Resource Leak - Temporary Files (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Problem**: Temporary files created during indirect conversion were never cleaned up, potentially filling up the /tmp directory.

**File Fixed**:
- `apps/api/app/services/format_converter.py`
  - Method: `_convert_indirect` (lines 821-912)

**Solution**:
1. **Replaced hardcoded temp file paths** with secure `tempfile.mkstemp()`:
   ```python
   # Before (insecure, no cleanup):
   temp_file = Path(f"/tmp/convert_{job_id}_{i}.{target}")
   
   # After (secure, with cleanup):
   fd, temp_path = await asyncio.to_thread(
       tempfile.mkstemp, suffix=suffix, prefix=prefix
   )
   await asyncio.to_thread(os.close, fd)
   temp_file = Path(temp_path)
   temp_files.append(temp_file)
   ```

2. **Added proper cleanup in finally block**:
   ```python
   finally:
       # Clean up all temporary files
       for temp_file in temp_files:
           try:
               if temp_file.exists():
                   await asyncio.to_thread(temp_file.unlink)
                   logger.debug(f"Cleaned up temporary file: {temp_file}")
           except Exception as cleanup_error:
               logger.warning(f"Failed to clean up temporary file {temp_file}: {cleanup_error}")
   ```

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Consistency**: All job IDs now use the same 32-bit signed integer format
2. **No Resource Leaks**: Temporary files are always cleaned up, even if conversion fails
3. **Security**: Using `tempfile.mkstemp()` provides secure temp file creation with unique names
4. **Async-Safe**: All file operations wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` for proper async handling
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Cleanup happens in finally block, ensuring it runs even on errors

## Testing Performed

Created and ran comprehensive test script (`test_pr538_fixes.py`) that verified:
- Job IDs are consistently generated as 32-bit signed integers
- Temporary files are properly created and cleaned up
- Secure temp file creation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`

All tests passed successfully.

## Code Quality

- Ran `ruff` linter and fixed all formatting issues
- Added proper comments explaining the changes
- Maintained Turkish language consistency in log messages
