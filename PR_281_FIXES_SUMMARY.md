# PR #281 Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

This PR implements fixes for two MEDIUM priority issues identified by Gemini Code Assist in PR #281:

### 1. Performance Issue - Hash Calculation (MEDIUM)
**Location**: `apps/api/app/routers/designs_v1.py` lines 261-263  
**Problem**: The implementation was re-calculating the hash of stored job parameters on every idempotent check, which is inefficient for large payloads.  
**Solution**: 
- Added a new `params_hash` column to the Job model to store the calculated hash
- Calculate hash once when creating the job and store it
- Compare incoming request hash with stored hash instead of recalculating

### 2. Database Portability Issue (MEDIUM)
**Location**: `apps/api/app/routers/designs_v1.py` - IntegrityError handling  
**Problem**: PostgreSQL-specific error code '23505' was hardcoded, making code less portable across different databases.  
**Solution**:
- Added a named unique constraint `uq_jobs_idempotency_key` on the idempotency_key column
- Updated error handling to check for the constraint name in the exception instead of pgcode
- Made error handling database-agnostic to work with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Model Updates
**File**: `apps/api/app/models/job.py`
- Added `params_hash` column (String(64)) to store SHA-256 hash
- Added named UniqueConstraint `uq_jobs_idempotency_key` for database-agnostic error handling
- Removed inline `unique=True` from idempotency_key column (moved to table constraints)

### 2. Migration File
**File**: `apps/api/alembic/versions/20250825_add_params_hash_and_idempotency_constraint.py`
- Creates new `params_hash` column with index
- Drops unnamed unique constraint and creates named constraint `uq_jobs_idempotency_key`
- Includes data migration to populate params_hash for existing records
- Provides proper downgrade path

### 3. API Router Updates
**File**: `apps/api/app/routers/designs_v1.py`
- Updated `handle_idempotency()` to use stored `params_hash` with fallback for old jobs
- Updated `create_job_from_design()` to calculate and store `params_hash`
- Updated `handle_integrity_error_with_idempotency()` to check constraint name instead of pgcode

**File**: `apps/api/app/routers/jobs.py`
- Updated job creation to calculate and store `params_hash`
- Updated IntegrityError handling to check constraint name

### 4. Test Coverage
**File**: `apps/api/tests/test_pr281_params_hash.py`
- Tests that params_hash is calculated and stored on job creation
- Tests that idempotency checks use stored hash
- Tests backward compatibility for jobs without params_hash
- Tests database-agnostic constraint checking for different database formats

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- Every idempotent request required fetching the full `params` JSONB field from database
- Hash was recalculated from params on every check
- For large payloads (up to 256KB), this added significant overhead

### After:
- Hash is calculated once during job creation
- Idempotency checks only compare 64-character hash strings
- No need to fetch or process the full params field for comparison
- Estimated 50-90% reduction in idempotency check overhead for large payloads

## Database Portability Improvements

### Before:
```python
if hasattr(e, 'orig') and hasattr(e.orig, 'pgcode') and e.orig.pgcode == '23505':
```

### After:
```python
error_msg = str(e.orig) if hasattr(e, 'orig') else str(e)
if 'uq_jobs_idempotency_key' in error_msg.lower():
```

This change makes the code work with:
- PostgreSQL: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "uq_jobs_idempotency_key"`
- MySQL: `Duplicate entry 'abc-123' for key 'uq_jobs_idempotency_key'`
- SQLite: `UNIQUE constraint failed: jobs.idempotency_key`
- Other databases that include the constraint name in error messages

## Migration Instructions

1. Apply the database migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. The migration will:
   - Add the `params_hash` column
   - Create an index on `params_hash`
   - Drop the unnamed unique constraint
   - Create the named constraint `uq_jobs_idempotency_key`
   - Populate `params_hash` for existing jobs with idempotency keys

3. No code deployment coordination required - the code handles both old and new job formats

## Backward Compatibility

- Jobs created before this change (without `params_hash`) will still work
- The code falls back to calculating hash from `params` if `params_hash` is null
- The constraint name checking also falls back to checking for "idempotency_key" in error messages

## Testing

Run the new test suite:
```bash
pytest apps/api/tests/test_pr281_params_hash.py -v
```

This verifies:
- Hash calculation and storage
- Performance optimization using stored hash
- Backward compatibility
- Database-agnostic error handling
