# PR #500 - Gemini Code Review Fixes

## Summary
This PR addresses all code review feedback from Gemini for PR #500, improving code performance, readability, and correctness according to enterprise standards.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Performance Optimization - NUMERIC_FIELDS (redis_operation_store.py)
**Issue**: NUMERIC_FIELDS was defined as a tuple but used for membership testing
**Fix**: Converted from tuple to set for O(1) membership testing performance
```python
# Before (tuple - O(n) membership testing)
NUMERIC_FIELDS = ('job_id', 'timestamp', ...)

# After (set - O(1) membership testing)  
NUMERIC_FIELDS = {'job_id', 'timestamp', ...}
```
**Impact**: Improved performance for Redis field type checking operations

### 2. Code Simplification - format_enum Logic (freecad_with_progress.py)
**Issue**: Complex and brittle format_enum logic with nested conditions
**Fix**: Simplified with cleaner three-step approach
```python
# Clean approach with separated concerns:
# Step 1: Try exact match
format_enum = FORMAT_MAP.get(format_lower)

# Step 2: If no exact match, try partial match
if format_enum is None:
    for key, value in FORMAT_MAP.items():
        if key in format_lower or format_lower in key:
            format_enum = value
            break

# Step 3: Default to FCSTD if no match found
if format_enum is None:
    format_enum = ExportFormat.FCSTD
```
**Impact**: Better readability and maintainability

### 3. Correct Logging Practice - exc_info Parameter (progress_reporter.py)
**Issue**: exc_info=True used incorrectly outside except block
**Fix**: Removed exc_info=True from logger.error call outside exception handler
```python
# Before (incorrect - no active exception)
logger.error(
    f"No phase mapping found for Assembly4Phase.{phase.name}.",
    exc_info=True  # Wrong: no active exception here
)

# After (correct)
logger.error(
    f"No phase mapping found for Assembly4Phase.{phase.name}."
)
```
**Impact**: Correct logging behavior, prevents potential errors

## Additional Improvements (from linter)
- Fixed whitespace and formatting issues
- Updated type hints to use modern pipe notation (X | Y)
- Removed unused variable assignments
- Added missing newlines at end of files
- Improved overall code consistency

## Testing
All changes have been tested to ensure:
- NUMERIC_FIELDS correctly uses set operations
- Format enum logic handles all test cases correctly
- Logging works properly without exc_info errors

## Files Modified
- `apps/api/app/services/redis_operation_store.py`
- `apps/api/app/tasks/freecad_with_progress.py`
- `apps/api/app/workers/progress_reporter.py`

## Best Practices Applied
- **Python idioms**: Using set for membership testing
- **Clean code**: Simplified complex logic for better readability
- **Correct API usage**: Proper use of logging parameters
- **Performance**: O(1) operations where applicable
- **Type hints**: Modern Python type annotations

All changes align with enterprise-grade code quality standards and FreeCAD integration best practices.
