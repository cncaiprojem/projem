---

## Implementation Phases

### PHASE 1: Cleanup and Analysis ✅
- **Scanned entire codebase** for existing Task 2.7 files - none found
- **Analyzed current schema** from Tasks 2.3-2.6 completion
- **Reviewed Task Master ERD** compliance requirements
- **Validated dependencies** - all prerequisite tasks completed

### PHASE 2: Unique Constraints Applied ✅

Implemented comprehensive unique constraints per Task Master ERD:

| Table | Column | Constraint Name | Purpose |
|-------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| `users` | `email` | `uq_users_email` | Prevent duplicate accounts |
| `users` | `phone` | `uq_users_phone` | Unique contact information |
| `sessions` | `refresh_token_hash` | `uq_sessions_refresh_token_hash` | JWT security |
| `jobs` | `idempotency_key` | `uq_jobs_idempotency_key` | Prevent duplicate processing |
| `artefacts` | `s3_key` | `uq_artefacts_s3_key` | Unique file storage |
| `invoices` | `number` | `uq_invoices_number` | Business invoice numbering |
| `payments` | `(provider, provider_ref)` | `uq_payments_provider_provider_ref` | Unique payment references |

### PHASE 3: Foreign Key Constraint Review ✅

Validated and optimized foreign key behaviors per ERD:

- **RESTRICT (Default)**: Prevents accidental data loss
  - `users.*` → All dependent tables use RESTRICT
  - `jobs.user_id` → RESTRICT (preserve job history)
  - `sessions.user_id` → RESTRICT (explicit cleanup required)
  - `invoices.user_id` → RESTRICT (financial audit trail)
  - `payments.*` → RESTRICT (financial integrity)
  
- **CASCADE (Specific Cases)**: Automatic cleanup
  - `artefacts.job_id` → CASCADE (cleanup artifacts with job)

### PHASE 4: Enhanced Check Constraints ✅

Applied domain-specific validation rules:

#### Financial Constraints (Banking-Level Precision)
- `invoices.amount_cents >= 0` - Non-negative amounts
- `payments.amount_cents > 0` - Positive payments only
- Multi-currency support with TRY-first policy

#### User Data Validation
- `ck_users_email_format` - RFC-compliant email validation
- `ck_users_phone_format` - Turkish phone number format (+90xxx or 0xxx)

#### Business Logic Constraints
- `ck_artefacts_size_positive` - File size must be positive
- `ck_sessions_expires_future` - Expiry must be after creation
- `ck_licenses_seats_positive` - License seats must be positive
- `ck_licenses_valid_period` - End date after start date

### PHASE 5: Performance Indexes ✅

Implemented comprehensive indexing strategy:

#### Standard Performance Indexes
```sql
-- Job processing optimization
idx_jobs_user_type_status (user_id, type, status, created_at)
idx_jobs_priority_status (priority, status) WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'RUNNING')

-- License management
idx_licenses_user_status_ends (user_id, status, ends_at)
idx_licenses_expiring_soon (ends_at) WHERE expires within 30 days

-- User activity tracking
idx_users_role_status (role, status)
idx_users_last_login (last_login_at) WHERE last_login_at IS NOT NULL

-- Session cleanup optimization
idx_sessions_cleanup (expires_at, revoked_at) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL

-- Financial query optimization
idx_invoices_user_currency_status (user_id, currency, status, issued_at)
idx_payments_user_currency_status (user_id, currency, status, paid_at)

-- File management
idx_artefacts_job_type_size (job_id, type, size_bytes)
```

### PHASE 6: JSONB GIN Indexes ✅

PostgreSQL 17.6 optimized JSONB indexing:

| Table | Column | Index Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| `users` | `metadata` | User preference queries |
| `jobs` | `input_params` | Job parameter searches |
| `jobs` | `metrics` | Performance metric analysis |
| `jobs` | `output_data` | Result data queries |
| `licenses` | `features` | Feature availability checks |
| `invoices` | `meta` | Invoice detail searches |
| `payments` | `meta` | Payment metadata queries |
| `artefacts` | `meta` | File metadata searches |
| `audit_logs` | `payload` | Audit event analysis |

**PostgreSQL 17.6 Optimizations Applied**:
- `fastupdate = on` - Better write performance
- `gin_pending_list_limit = 4096` - Optimized for bulk operations

### PHASE 7: Documentation and Comments ✅

Added comprehensive documentation:

#### Table Comments
- Users: "User accounts with role-based access control and Turkish compliance (GDPR/KVKK)"
- Sessions: "JWT refresh token management with device fingerprinting and security tracking"
- Jobs: "Asynchronous task queue with idempotency, retry logic, and comprehensive metrics"
- Financial: "Turkish financial compliance (KDV) and multi-currency support"
- Audit: "Enterprise audit trail with cryptographic hash-chain integrity"

#### Column-Level Documentation
- All critical fields documented with business purpose
- Constraint explanations for maintenance teams
- Performance optimization notes

### PHASE 8: Performance Monitoring ✅

Created enterprise monitoring infrastructure:

#### Materialized View: `system_performance_summary`
```sql
-- Real-time system performance metrics
- Job status distribution and average duration
- User activity and verification rates  
- License utilization and expiry tracking
- Automatic refresh capabilities
```

#### Monitoring Indexes
- `idx_system_performance_entity_type` - Fast metric queries
- Performance baseline establishment
- Operational excellence tracking
