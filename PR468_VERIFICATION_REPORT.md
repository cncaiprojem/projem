# PR #468 Code Review Verification Report

## Summary
All code review feedback from PR #468 has been verified and confirmed as already fixed.

## Verification Results ✅

### 1. **Batch Delete Logic** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue:** Incorrect for-else pattern where `else` was associated with `for` loop
- **Fix Applied:** Uses explicit `error_count` variable to track errors
- **Location:** `apps/api/app/services/storage_client.py` (lines 763-798)
- **Status:** Correctly counts deletions only when `error_count == 0`

### 2. **MinIO Bucket Policy** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue:** AWS-specific IAM conditions (`aws:userid` with patterns like "AIDAI*", "AIDA*", "AROA*")
- **Fix Applied:** Simplified to basic deny-all policy without AWS-specific conditions
- **Location:** `apps/api/app/services/storage_client.py` (lines 890-911)
- **Status:** Uses simple `"Principal": "*"` with basic deny rules appropriate for MinIO

### 3. **S3 Key Uniqueness** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue:** Potential key collisions with same filename
- **Fix Applied:** Added UUID to path structure
- **Location:** `apps/api/app/services/artefact_service_v2.py` (lines 210-215)
- **Status:** Keys now use format: `jobs/{job_id}/{uuid}/{filename}`

### 4. **Import Organization** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue:** `datetime` imports inside loop
- **Fix Applied:** All imports at top of file
- **Location:** `apps/api/app/tasks/garbage_collection.py` (line 11)
- **Status:** `from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone` at top
