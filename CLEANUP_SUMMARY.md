# Task 1 Docker File Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup of duplicate and obsolete Docker/Compose files after completing all Task 1 subtasks (1.1-1.14). The cleanup consolidated Docker configurations and removed redundant files while maintaining the comprehensive Task 1 implementations.

## Files Removed

### Root Level Docker Compose Files (OBSOLETE)
- ❌ `./docker-compose.yml` - Old production compose, replaced by comprehensive development setup
- ❌ `./docker-compose.dev.yml` - Old development overrides, replaced by comprehensive version
- ❌ `./docker-compose.prod.yml` - Old production compose, outdated configuration

### Partial Service Files (REDUNDANT)
- ❌ `./apps/web/docker-compose.web.yml` - Partial web-only compose, replaced by comprehensive stack
- ❌ `./infra/docker/docker-compose.utilities.yml` - Separate utilities compose, now integrated

### Duplicate Dockerfiles (DUPLICATE)
- ❌ `./apps/api/Dockerfile.freecad` - Duplicate of `infra/docker/freecad/Dockerfile`

## Files Kept (Task 1 Implementations)

### Comprehensive Docker Compose (Task 1.10)
- ✅ `./infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` - Complete development environment with all services

### Application Dockerfiles (Task 1.7 & 1.8)
- ✅ `./apps/api/Dockerfile` - FastAPI backend container
- ✅ `./apps/api/Dockerfile.workers` - Celery workers container
- ✅ `./apps/web/Dockerfile` - Next.js frontend container

### Utility Service Dockerfiles (Task 1.9)
- ✅ `./infra/docker/freecad/Dockerfile` - FreeCAD utility service
- ✅ `./infra/docker/camotics/Dockerfile` - CAMotics simulation service
- ✅ `./infra/docker/ffmpeg/Dockerfile` - FFmpeg video processing service
- ✅ `./infra/docker/clamav/Dockerfile` - ClamAV antivirus service

## Updated References

### Makefile Updates
- Updated `DC` variable to point to `infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml`
- Simplified `dev-full` command (now same as `dev`)
- Updated help text to reflect new structure

### GitHub Workflows
- Updated `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` compose file path
- Updated `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml` compose file path

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `apps/api/DOCKER_SETUP.md` compose file references
- Updated `RABBITMQ_SETUP.md` compose file paths
- Updated `docs/rabbitmq-integration.md` compose file references

## New Architecture

### Single Source of Truth
The project now uses a single, comprehensive development compose file:
```
./infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml
```

This file includes:
- All application services (API, Web, Workers)
- All infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO)
- All utility services (FreeCAD, CAMotics, FFmpeg, ClamAV)
- Complete networking, volumes, and health checks
- Security hardening and resource limits

### Make Commands
All make commands now use the unified compose file:
```bash
make dev        # Start complete development stack
make stop       # Stop all services
make logs       # View all service logs
make build      # Build all images
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Management**: Single compose file for all development needs
2. **Consistency**: No conflicting configurations between multiple files
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain single source
4. **Security**: Latest security configurations from Task 1 implementations
5. **Completeness**: All services properly integrated and configured

## Verification

All cleanup was verified with:
- No remaining obsolete compose files in root directory
- No duplicate Dockerfiles
- All references updated to new paths
- Make commands working correctly
- Documentation updated consistently

The project now has a clean, consolidated Docker setup that reflects the completed Task 1 implementation.
