# PR #497 Code Review Fixes

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. SSE Reconnection Logic (CRITICAL)
**File:** `apps/api/app/api/v1/sse.py`

**Problem:** Missed events were fetched but never sent to the client during SSE reconnection.

**Solution:** 
- Moved missed event fetching and yielding to the SSE event generator itself
- Fetch and yield missed events BEFORE subscribing to new events
- Apply the same filters (milestones_only, event_filter) to missed events as new events
- Properly track event IDs to maintain sequence

**Key Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE: Missed events fetched in Redis but discarded
async with redis_progress_pubsub.subscribe_to_job(job_id, last_event_id) as pubsub:
    # Events were fetched internally but never yielded

# AFTER: Fetch and send missed events first
if last_event_id is not None:
    missed_events = await redis_progress_pubsub.get_missed_events(job_id, last_event_id)
    for event_json in missed_events:
        # Parse, filter, and yield each missed event to client
        yield sse_event

# Then subscribe for new events
async with redis_progress_pubsub.subscribe_to_job(job_id) as pubsub:
```

### 2. Redis Pub/Sub Simplification (CRITICAL)
**File:** `apps/api/app/core/redis_pubsub.py`

**Problem:** The `subscribe_to_job` method had unnecessary complexity with `last_event_id` parameter.

**Solution:**
- Removed `last_event_id` parameter from `subscribe_to_job` method
- Removed deprecated `_send_missed_events` internal method
- Simplified the subscription logic to only handle channel subscription
- Let SSE endpoint handle missed events directly using `get_missed_events()`

## High Priority Issues Fixed

### 3. WebSocket Resource Leak (HIGH)
**File:** `apps/api/app/api/v1/websocket.py`

**Problem:** The `disconnect` method wasn't async and didn't properly stop centralized listeners.

**Solution:**
- Made `disconnect` method async
- Call `unsubscribe_from_job` for all job subscriptions during disconnect
- This ensures centralized listener tasks are properly stopped
- Prevents resource leaks from orphaned listener tasks

**Key Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE: Synchronous disconnect with manual cleanup
def disconnect(self, connection_id: str) -> None:
    # Manual cleanup that could miss listener shutdown

# AFTER: Async disconnect with proper cleanup
async def disconnect(self, connection_id: str) -> None:
    # Unsubscribe from all jobs (stops listeners)
    for job_id in list(self.connection_jobs[connection_id]):
        await self.unsubscribe_from_job(connection_id, job_id)
```

### 4. Numeric Type Conversion (HIGH)
**File:** `apps/api/app/services/redis_operation_store.py`

**Problem:** Using '.' to decide between int/float conversion was unreliable.

**Solution:**
- Try int conversion first
- Fall back to float if int fails
- Keep as string if both conversions fail
- More robust and handles edge cases like scientific notation

**Key Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE: Brittle detection based on '.'
context[field_name] = float(field_value) if '.' in field_value else int(field_value)

# AFTER: Robust try-except chain
try:
    context[field_name] = int(field_value)
except ValueError:
    try:
        context[field_name] = float(field_value)
    except ValueError:
        context[field_name] = field_value
```

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 5. WebSocket Cleanup Simplification (MEDIUM)
**File:** `apps/api/app/api/v1/websocket.py`

**Problem:** Cleanup logic in finally block was redundant.

**Solution:**
- Removed manual `unsubscribe_from_job` call in finally block
- Just call the async `disconnect` method which handles everything
- Cleaner and more maintainable code

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
1. SSE sends missed events to clients on reconnection
2. SSE applies filters to missed events correctly
3. WebSocket disconnect properly cleans up resources
4. Redis subscribe method simplified correctly
5. Numeric conversion handles all edge cases

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
- **No data loss during SSE reconnections** - Clients receive all missed events
- **No resource leaks in WebSocket connections** - Proper cleanup of all listeners
- **More reliable data type handling** - Robust numeric conversions from Redis
- **Cleaner, more maintainable code** - Simplified abstractions and better separation of concerns
