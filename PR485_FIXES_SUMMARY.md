# PR #485 - Gemini Review Feedback Fixes

## Summary
Successfully fixed all 3 issues identified by Gemini in PR #485 review.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ HIGH - Test Assertion Wrong
**File**: `apps/api/tests/test_cache_performance.py`
**Issue**: Test was still asserting hash length is 16 (old behavior)
**Fix**: 
- Updated test to check `len(parts[-1]) > 40` for full base64 SHA256 hash
- Fixed key format assertions to match new abbreviated format (`:f:` for flow, `:a:` for artifact)
- Added comment explaining expected hash length (~43 chars for base64 SHA256)

### 2. ✅ MEDIUM - Type Hint Too Generic  
**File**: `apps/api/app/core/cache.py`
**Issue**: `InFlightCoalescer.coalesce` had generic `func: Callable` parameter
**Fix**:
- Changed type hint to `func: Callable[[], Awaitable[Any]]`
- Properly indicates the function is async and returns an awaitable
- Already had `Awaitable` imported in the file

### 3. ✅ MEDIUM - Async Loop Management
**File**: `apps/api/app/workers/freecad_worker_optimizer.py`
**Issue**: Manually creating event loop with `asyncio.new_event_loop()` is error-prone
**Fix**:
- Replaced with `asyncio.run()` for Python 3.7+ best practices
- Added RuntimeError fallback for when already in event loop
- Follows same pattern as `before_start` method for consistency

## Verification
All fixes were tested and verified:
- Cache key generation produces 43-character base64 hashes
- Type hints are valid and properly typed for async callables
- Async loop management uses modern patterns with proper fallback

## Files Modified
1. `apps/api/tests/test_cache_performance.py` - Test assertion fix
2. `apps/api/app/core/cache.py` - Type hint improvement
3. `apps/api/app/workers/freecad_worker_optimizer.py` - Async loop modernization
